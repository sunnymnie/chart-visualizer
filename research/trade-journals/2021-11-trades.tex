\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{2021-11-01-15}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{2021-11-01-60}
\subsubsection{Reason}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Textbook complex-pullback buy. Using 50\% total USDT.
  \item Greedy, bought early for average price of around 1.13.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Position}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Currently have 878 OCEAN
  \item Visual stop loss at 0.95ish.
  \item Plan to liquidate half at 1.25 (previous high), another half at 1.30 ish.
  \item Default time limit at 3 days
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Nov 2: 12:41}
\subsubsection{Update}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Prices have slid down to 1.05, but no abrupt downward momentum. Visual stop loss at 0.95 is still respected. 
\end{itemize}

\section{TRX/USDT}
\subsection{Nov 2, 10:48 - 3x 150USDT $\bigtriangleup$}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{2021-11-02-trx-15}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{2021-11-02-trx-60}

\subsubsection{Reason}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Hit support and decide to buy
  \item Ranges for pullback are much smaller than those of previous rally
  \item 4h timeline scrolling back reveals uptrend starting from July, 3-4 months of up, although balancing out over that past month with little activity
  \item 1h timeline can see spike in MACD similar in size to rally a few days back from a massive sell-off
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Position}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Currently have 4168 TRX
  \item Visual stop loss at 0.104
  \item Visual take profit at 0.11 (around half 2000 TRX)
  \item Default time limit at 3 days
\end{itemize}

\section{DENT/USDT}
\subsection{Nov 2, 12:05 - 3x 150USDT $\bigtriangleup$}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{2021-11-02-dent-15}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{2021-11-02-dent-60}
\subsubsection{Reason}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Hit support, but bought a few minutes too early. Did not wait for prices to rebound back above support.
  \item 1h spike in MACD larger than all nearby
  \item 4h solid uptrend since September. Otherwise fell from highs in August.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Position}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Currently have 58154 DENT
  \item Visual take profit at 0.0083 (half)
  \item Visual stop loss at 0.0071
  \item Default time limit at 3 days
\end{itemize}
